CS631 -- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment - Fall 2012 - HW#5

HW#5: write a simple tool to perform encryption/decryption of content

Summary

In this assignment you will write a small, standalone tool following 
standard Unix conventions that performs encryption or decryption of 
its input. Even though other tools exist to accomplish this task, it
is useful to learn how to perform the basic steps to call the common
SSL library functions involved in this task.

Problem assignment

Write a simple program to encrypt or decrypt its input using the SSL
blowfish(3) cipher. Your program is defined in this manual page. 
As before, your program will:

follow the general homework guidelines
be written in C (not C++ or anything else)
not generate any output other than error messages when appropriate
Note: this assignment is worth 30 points.

Deliverables and Due Date

You will submit a single tar archive named username-hw5.tar that will
extract into a directory named after your username. In that directory
will be at least a file named bfed.c and an optional Makefile. If you
have any commentary on your submission, include it in a file called
README.

For example, I would submit the file jschauma-hw5.tar which might 
extract as follows:

$ tar xvf jschauma-hw5.tar
jschauma
jschauma/Makefile
jschauma/README
jschauma/bfed.c
$ cd jschauma
$ cc -Wall bfed.c
$
The due date for this assignment is 2012-12-10 18:15. Please attach the
file to an email sent from your @stevens.edu email address to
jschauma@stevens.edu with a subject of "[CS631] HW5".
